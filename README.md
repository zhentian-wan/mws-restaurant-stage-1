## Project Overview: Stage 2

**Dear Reviewers from Udacity**

Thanks for your time reviewing my works, here is the instruction to help you easily run the project.

1. Please run the code in **production mode** when reviewing the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
